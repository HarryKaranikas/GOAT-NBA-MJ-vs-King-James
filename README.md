# GOAT-NBA-MJ-vs-King-James
Who is the GOAT??


If aliens came to earth and have ONE game to save Humanity.
Who's is your first peak in the history of the world.

It's the never-ending debate among today's NBA fans: Michael Jordan vs. LeBron James. Or should that be LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan?
I decided to take into account 4 factors.

1.Game Score
Who has the greatest Game Score? (Average)
2.Longevity
Who has played the most minutes in NBA? (Cumulative)
3.Winnings
Who has won the most titles? (Cumulative)
4.Statistics
Who is the better with the ball? (Average)
Who is the better without the ball? (Average)
Who has on average the most points? (Average)
